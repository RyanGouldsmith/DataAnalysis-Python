01:001:001 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

01:001:002 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was
           upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon
           the face of the waters.

01:001:003 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

01:001:004 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the
           light from the darkness.

01:001:005 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called
           Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

01:001:006 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the
           waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.

01:001:007 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were
           under the firmament from the waters which were above the
           firmament: and it was so.

01:001:008 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
           morning were the second day.

01:001:009 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered
           together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it
           was so.

01:001:010 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together
           of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.

01:001:011 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb
           yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his
           kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.

01:001:012 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed
           after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in
           itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

01:001:013 And the evening and the morning were the third day.

01:001:014 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the
           heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for
           signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:

01:001:015 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to
           give light upon the earth: and it was so.

01:001:016 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the
           day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars
           also.

01:001:017 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light
           upon the earth,

01:001:018 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the
           light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.

01:001:019 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

01:001:020 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
           creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth
           in the open firmament of heaven.
